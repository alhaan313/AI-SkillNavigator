# AI-Powered Personalized Learning System

## Problem
Traditional courses often fail to engage students effectively because the content is generic and not tailored to their specific needs or interests. This leads to disengagement and reduced learning outcomes. There is a need for a dynamic and personalized learning experience that adapts to individual preferences, making learning more relevant and motivating for students.

## Solution
The **AI-Powered Personalized Learning System** solves this problem by using AI to generate personalized content based on each student's interests. This makes learning more engaging and relevant. The system adapts in real-time, ensuring that students are always learning through content that aligns with their preferences and needs. Additionally, features like feedback collection, performance visualization, and batch allocation help students track their progress, while the system adjusts to improve their learning journey.
